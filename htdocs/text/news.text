Possible thread timing issue with GParted 0.16.0
<br>
Since the release of GParted 0.16.0, we have discovered another
potential issue with timing and multiple threads.  This issue appears
to occur on older GNU/Linux distributions.  In fact the issue was not
apparent in our testing of GParted 0.16.0 on recent distros.<br>
<br>
For more details see <a
href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=695279">Bug 695279 -
GParted doesn't compile on RHEL / CentOS 5.9</a>.<br>
<br>
As a precaution we plan to keep GParted Live 0.16.0-1 in the testing
directory while we work towards a fix for this newly identified
issue.<br>
<br>
Until this problem is resolved we continue to advise using the last
stable release of GParted Live, which is <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gparted/files/gparted-live-stable/0.14.1-6/">GParted
Live 0.14.1-6</a>.

Avoid Using GParted 0.15.0 for Partition Moves, Resizes, Copies and Checks
<br>
We are investigating reports of intermittent crashes with GParted
0.15.0.<br>
See
<a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=697727">Bug
697727 - Segfault in livecd Gparted v 0.15.0-3 when copying
partition</a>.<br>
<br>
The risk of <b><u>LOSS of DATA</u></b> is highest when performing
partition moves, resizes, copies, and checks.  As such we recommend
using GParted 0.14.1 for all move, resize, copy, and check
operations.<br>
<br>
Other operations such as create, delete, format, label, set UUID, and
delete might also crash, but these should not result in unexpected
data loss, and the operation can be repeated.<br>
<br>
Until this problem is resolved we advise using the last stable release
of GParted Live, which
is <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gparted/files/gparted-live-stable/0.14.1-6/">GParted
Live 0.14.1-6</a>.<br>
<br>
We highly recommend that you <b><u>BACKUP your DATA</u></b> before
using <b><i>any partitioning tool</i></b>.<br>

<li>Unable to shrink HFS and HFS+ file systems</li>
<li>Unable to determine used and unused sectors in HFS and HFS+ file systems
</li>
<li>Unable to erase file system signatures on partition create and format
</li>
<li>FAT16 and FAT32 file system moves performed internally by
    GParted instead of by libparted</li>
</ul>
Other key changes include:
<ul>
<li>Fix size off by one sector with unrecognized disk label</li>
<li>Fix GParted crashes with assertion (head_size <= 63)
  <ul>
  <li>Requires libparted-2.4 or higher</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

The GParted official web site is now gparted.org
<br>
The <a href="http://gparted.org">gparted.org</a> domain name has been

GParted web site to move to gparted.org
<br>
On October 6, 2010, the GParted web site will be migrated from
gparted.sourceforge.net to the gparted.org domain name.<br>
<br>
Currently the gparted.org domain name simply redirects to the
gparted.sourceforge.net domain.  After this change, gparted.org will
become the primary domain name for GParted.<br>
<br>
Since the steps to setup the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/wiki/Custom%20VHOSTs">virtual
host (VHOST) configuration</a> involve several hours of time delays,
please bear with us while the change is made.<br>
<br>
Your patience is appreciated.

GParted 0.6.0
<br>
The GParted team is proud to announce this release brings
support for devices with sector sizes greater than 512 bytes.<br>
<br>
For the last three decades, 512 byte sector sizes have been
the norm and many tools, including GParted, were hard coded to
assume this sector size.<br>
<br>
Also included in this release are bug fixes, and language
translation updates.
<br><br>
Key changes include:
<ul>
<li>Add support for devices with sector sizes > 512 bytes</li>
<li>Add alignment option to align to MiB</li>
<li>Set _default_ alignment to align to MiB</li>
</ul>
<br>
Known issues:<br>
- When used with libparted versions 2.3 and lower on devices with
sector sizes > 512 bytes:
<ul>
<li>hfs/hfs+: used/unused space not detected</li>
<li>hfs/hfs+: shrink file system not available</li>
</ul>

Suggested Patches for Parted 2.2
<br>
It appears that the Parted 1.9.0 through 2.2 releases have lost some
capability that earlier releases (1.8.8 and earlier) possessed.<br>
<br>
These newer Parted releases are unable to inform the kernel of
partition changes if another partition is mounted, or if an active LVM
partition is on the same device.<br>
This latter case was reported in the following bug report:<br>
<a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=608712">Bug 608712 - GParted fails to edit/delete partitions if active LVM on same disk device</a><br>
<br>
Fortunately, the parted git repository contains updates that restore
this capability.<br>
<br>
In light of this and potential problems with dmraid, Steven Shiau has
kindly updated GParted Live 0.5.2-9 with the following three
patches:<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://git.debian.org/?p=parted/parted.git;a=commit;h=c1eb485b9fd8919e18f192d678bc52b0488e6ee0">libparted: don't canonicalize /dev/mapper paths
</a></li>
<li><a href="http://git.debian.org/?p=parted/parted.git;a=commit;h=0e04d17386274fc218a9e6f9ae17d75510e632a3">libparted: reenable use of BLKPG ioctls</a></li>
<li><a href="http://git.debian.org/?p=parted/parted.git;a=commit;h=7165951dfb584aae2901ac3f1a28fe3624667f19
">libparted: improve BLKPG error checking</a></li>
</ul>
The above three patches improve support for DMRAID, and permit editing
unmounted partitions on devices that have at least one mounted
partition and/or an active LVM partition.<br>
<br>
We recommend the above three patches be applied to parted-2.2 if you
are compiling your own copy of Parted or using libparted with GParted.

Problems with Partition Resizing Continue
<br>
Unfortunately it appears that partition resizing problems continue with GParted Live versions 0.4.8-1 through 0.5.0-3.<br>
<br>
In the case of the NTFS file system, The error message seen after the
partition is resized is:<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ERROR: Current NTFS volume size is bigger than the device size!<br>
<br>
The problem appears to be related to the combination of packages,
Linux kernel, and patches used in the GParted Live image.  We are
investigating to find the root cause of the problem.<br>
<br>
Until this problem is solved we recommend
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gparted/files/gparted-live-stable/OldFiles/0.4.6-1/">GParted Live 0.4.6-1</a>
for resizing all file systems.<br>
<br>
The bug report to track this problem is
<a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=604298">bug #604298</a>.<br>
<br>
The forum post
<a href="http://gparted-forum.surf4.info/viewtopic.php?id=13777">"WARNING! Problem Resizing File Systems with GParted"</a>

GParted 0.4.1
<br>
This release of GParted rolls back /dev/mapper/* detection.<br>
<br>
The problem was that all /dev/mapper/* entries were added to the
device list including LVM partitions.  This was confusing behaviour
to GParted users, and in my opinion it was better to roll back
this change.<br>
<br>
A work-around for /dev/mapper/* device detection is available by
passing the device names to gparted on the command line.<br>
E.g.,<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; gparted /dev/mapper/device-name<br>
<br>
Thanks to François Dupoux for identifying this problem early, and
working towards a resolution.<br>

Gparted SVN repository migrated back to gnome.org
<br>
Thanks to help from a few folks at gnome.org, both Larry and I have gnome SVN accounts.
This cleared the way to migrate the recent work performed in the Source Forge repository over to gnome.org.
Now the language translation updates, and the code updates are maintained in a single responsitory.
This eases the maintenance tasks for Larry and myself.

GParted 0.3.5
<p><br>
This release is the first one from a new set of project maintainers
(Laurent de Trogoff, and Curtis Gedak).  The release includes changes
from the unofficial 0.3.4 release as well as bug fixes, and language
translations.
<br><br>
One key bug fix is that gparted no longer crashes when a device
list refresh is performed.
<br><br>
*Many Thanks* go to Bart Hakvoort.
<br>
Without Bart's work, there would be no GParted.
<br><br>

Things are going on !
<p><br>
After he created and maintained the GParted project, Bart (plors)<br>
lastely took the decision to let his project in other hands.<br>
Curtis and I are now working on the project.<br>
As C++ dev, Curtis should be able to update and upgrade GParted,<br>
from day to day, and I will do my best to give him help.<br>
<br>
Because we do not have full access to the svn.gnome at the moment,<br>
we decided to set the Gparted <a href="svn.php" target="new">SVN</a> in SF.<br><br>
<br>
Be happy : we should release 0.3.5 before a long time :)<br>

Good news for GPARTED !
<p><br>
I am happy to announce you a new C++ dev has reached the Gparted team !<br>
Curtis G. from Alberta (Canada), contacted me a couple of weeks<br>
to work on the project.<br>
After one year without any changes, we plane to enable some new features,<br>
like label creation, ext4 support, and maybe other tips. One of our goals will<br>
be to fix bugs too of course...<br>
The real work will begin in about two months or so.<br>
The official site may be unavialable during some days for technical reasons.<br><br>
If someone is interested by setting an offical livecd for gparted,<br>
we will consider any project. If nobody comes, no livecd comes neither.<br>

New GParted-livecd site !
<p>
After I took advice from some people, espacially from JanC which maitains our forum,<br>
a GParted-livecd web site has been created on Tuxfamily.<br>
See <a href="http://gparted-livecd.tuxfamily.org/" target="new">here</a>.<br><br>
I needed "write" access to add new users who would like to work on the project.<br>
Since it is not possible to contact Bart (the "father" of the GParted project),<br>
I needed to take a decision. This is done.<br>
Another possibility was to request the *same* project on SF,<br>
but that meant I would push out of the project Bart Hakvoort,<br>
what I could not intend to make !<br>
If Bart Hakvoort ever comes back, he will take the end-decision.<br>
If he will not come back, we may continue working on the project by this way !<br><br>

Only the news page will be updated here,<br>
and I think I  will continue to use SF to upload release.<br><br>

New release is coming !
<p>
We are still looking for a NEW GParted-LiveCD Maintainer, but we didn't find anyone !<br>
That's the reason why I decided to try to release gparted-livecd by myself, in a couple of days.<br>
I have no time to work on bugs, and I am not able to make any change to gparted, because I don't even no one word of C++.<br>
If you are interesting with hacking gparted on C++, let me know ! <br><br>

So, a new release of the livecd is coming, soon :-p <br>

Looking for a NEW GParted-LiveCD Maintainer !
<p>
Dear you all,<br>
It is about 6 months since I carried on maintaining the GParted-LiveCD,<br>
and I tried to do my best to built and update it. Unfortunalty, I have <br>
definitly no time left to to continue this work !<br>
Some of you may know that I am a catholic monk, and my life<br>
let me very few time for this interesting but delicate work.<br>
Either I find a new live maintainer, either no release will be done before ages.<br>
<br>
Anyway users may use the Parted Magic livecd built by Patrick Werner who maintained<br> the first GParted livecd (See <a href='http://partedmagic.com/'>Parted Magic Site</a> for more details.<br><br>
As a consequence, bugs won't be fixed either.<br>
<br>
Thanks to Dennis German, a new wiki doc is online. See <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GParted'>Wiki Doc</a>.<br><br>
My best regards to all of you who gave me time or tips to fix that and that.<br>
I really appreciated it.<br>
Best wishes to all :)<br>

Shrinking / Growing / Moving VISTA
<p>
If you are interesting with shrinking VISTA, you must know GParted is able to shrink Vista.<br>
I have successfully performed this operation on two different machines !<br><br>
It is also possible to use GParted to move Vista partition, but you need Vista cd-dvd, to repair Vista Boot Manager.<br>
Some details are available <a href='http://gparted-forum.surf4.info/viewtopic.php?pid=3067#p3067'>here</a>.<br>
I also summarized the steps in a kind of <a href='http://gparted.free.fr/screenshots/VISTA/Howto_move_VISTA.html'>howto</a>.<br><br>
Note that there is a built-in tool in Vista to shrink your partition, not to move (afaik).<br>

GParted 0.3.1
<p>
This release is mostly a response on the feedback i got from users on GParted 0.3.<br>
In case of an overlapping move (which in case of failure may cause damage to a filesystem)
GParted now performs a readonly testrun. Also, if a move failes GParted will
rollback the transactions and hence insure the safety of your data.<br>

This version has some minor improvements. Nothing I can say here can top full<br>
move support in GParted, so I won't bore you with too many details. The coolest<br>
things are the new artwork by Junel Mujar and it's now possible to boot from a<br>
hard drive. The hw_random crash has also been fixed.<br><br>

GParted 0.3
<p>
It took a bit longer than expected, but finally we decided to release GParted-0.3. <br>
This release includes one of the most exiting features since the first release;<br>
<b>We finally have full move support!!</b> Although it should be considered a bit experimental,
our tests worked out perfectly and we didn't see any errors so far.<br>
<br>
Special thanks for this release go to:<br>
<b>JanC</b>, for the initial idea on how to implement moving.<br>
<b>Brother Larry</b>, for the enormous amount of time he put into testing and bughunting.<br>
Please send flowers and cake to these guys ;^)<br>
<br>
Ok, have fun, be carefull and report bugs :)<br>

GParted LiveCD 0.2.5-5
<p>
Minor update to fix some problems in the new video card
detection. Some cards were given the wrong driver and starting
X was not possible without manually editing the xorg.conf file.
If X fails to start use the "manual video card" option
in the boot menu. This reverts the system back to the behavior
of 0.2.5-3 for video card selecting.<br><br>
A screen shot program for reporting bugs was added.<br><br>
The "Boot failure: Unknown keyword in config file" is fixed.<br><br>

small update
<p>
Yep, i'm still alive and working on GParted :^)
My life is quite filled at the moment with study and work, but every now and then i manage to work a bit on GParted. Release 0.3 is not that far away and it includes a VERY nice feature: <b>moving of all filesystems</b> *drumroll here* :-)
<br><br>
This is something i've been willing to add to GParted for a long time and in the end it proved very simple. Credits for the idea go to JanC (please drop by on IRC to thank him ;) ).
<br><br>

In the meanwhile Patrick has been busy with the live environments and from the responses we get i can only conclude he is doing an extremely good job!
<br><br>

LarryT en Karderio are working on the docs and among other things they are preparing them for usage by the gnome help browser (Yelp). If everything goes as planned we can also include this in 0.3.
<br>
Having good documention is very important, especially now more and more relatively unexperienced users are using GParted.
<br><br>

Apart from this we are deploying a new forum in the hope to become more in touch with our users. It seems not everyone feels comfortable with bugzilla and IRC.
<br><br>

All in all, nothing but good news, please stay tuned for GParted-0.3 :-)
<br><br>

GParted LiveCD/LiveUSB 0.2.5-3
<p>
I added some goodies people have been asking for: partimage,<br>
grub, rsync, fdisk, cfdisk, and sfdisk. Links has also been<br>
included to view LarryT's docs while running the LiveCD and<br>
LiveUSB. Some other stuff was upgraded like adding a<br>
shutdown-menu and the entire layout of the root filesystem.<br>
All of the symbolic links and /fake/needwrite stuff is now<br>
gone. The entire rootfs is compressed with squashfs and the<br>
boot process has been vastly changed. This saved almost 5mb<br>
to add extras. The kernel was also updated to Linux-2.6.17.4.<br><br>
See the <a
 href='http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=430852&amp;group_id=115843'>Changelog</a> for details.<br>

We're back
<p>
Hmmz, it seems everything's restored. I was able to dig most of the stuff up from googlecache (thanks Jan GONDOL!).<br>
Because i'm too lazy to restore the newsentries (they live in a separate textfile) some news will be missing, but i don't think anyone is going to miss it :)<br>

Hopefully the SF guys can help me out, otherwise i'll have a lot of catching up to do. <br>

GParted-0.0.9
<p>
It certainly has been a long time since the last release. All of a sudden i got caught up in 'real life' and couldn't find the time to work on gparted anymore.<br>
It happens i suppose...<br>
<br>
Anyway, gparted-0.0.9 contains lots of fixes, a few new features and tons of updated/new translations.
See the <a href='http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=373712&amp;group_id=115843'>Changelog</a> for more information

I'm back ;-)
<p>
I'm back in the Netherlands and the next few months i'm a free man (hopefully).<br>
This means i should have plenty of time to work on GParted.<br>
After looking into bugzilla i plan on releasing gparted-0.0.9 which has been in CVS far too long.<br>
Once that's done i'll look into support for RAID and LVM.<br>
<br>
Stay tuned ;-)

Update
<p>
Judging from the load of mail i get, a lot of people are very concerned about my well-being. Thanks folks, i'm touched :P <BR><br>
To answer the one question on your minds: i'm neither dead nor sick and so is GParted. I'm on a studytrip for 4 months and i simply have very little time to work on GParted.<br><br>
As soon as i'm back in Holland (june/july) i'll start working on it again. In the meanwhile you can try <a href="http://gparted.sf.net/gparted-0.0.9pre2.tar.bz2">gparted-0.0.9pre2</a> if you want. <br>
enjoy :)

GParted 0.0.7
<p>
gparted-0.0.7 is finally here. It took some time, because i had to rewrite a lot of code.
Every filesystem now has its own class and is responsible for its own creation, resizing etc..
This makes it very easy to add more filesystems to gparted and that's what we all want :)<br>
<br>
Because the ext2/3 code of libparted was slightly outdated and sometimes caused trouble, gparted now
uses the e2fstools to handle them. Same goes for reiserfs, you now need the official tools from namesys to handle reiserfs partitions.<br>
<br>
Since most (all) of these tools lack decent API's i just call the commands from the code, this is a bit scary and definitely not considered
elegant coding, but i didn't have much choice and so far it works out quite well.<br>
<br>
At startuptime gparted scans for available commands and enables/disabled certain functionality. e.g. if 'mke2fs' is found, creation of ext2 is enabled.
This is quite cool since you can now enable support for filesystems without rebuilding gparted. just install the tools for your specific filesystem en (re)start gparted. That's all :)<br>
<br>
Of course using CLI-tools has some disadvantages. One of the most annoying is the lack of proper progressfeedback. Although i have some ideas on how to solve this, atm it's still just a dumb guess :)<br>
<br>
More information can be found in the  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=287614">Changelog</a><br>
<br>
Have fun and don't forget to report your bugs :^)

GParted 0.0.6
<p>
A brand-new GParted =)<br>
We now have support for <b>reiserfs</b> [1]<br>
Startup time is down with a couple of seconds (the gui gets loaded first and the deepscan of all partitions is performed later)<br>
Changes, Fixes, new and updated translations.... <br>
<br>
Since nothing else comes to mind i happily point at the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=277487">Changelog</a> :P
<br>
<br>
<br>
[1] Besides it's builtin filesystems, libparted also offers support for reiserfs through an extern package (progreiserfs).
The presence of this package is detected at runtime and support for reiserfs is enabled/disabled accordingly.<br>
Since progreiserfs is NOT the 'official' reiserfsprogs it's a good idea to use caution!<br>
Get it from <a href="ftp://ftp.namesys.com/pub/libreiserfs/progsreiserfs-0.3.0.5.tar.gz">

GParted 0.0.5
<p>
It took a bit longer then i'd hoped, but here it is: *drumbeats* gparted-0.0.5 !
As planned, this release includes support for other languages, so the non-english speakers out there can enjoy gparted as well.<br>
I've also made a few (minor) changes to the graphical interface and fixed a number of bugs, see the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=271829">changelog</a> for more details.
Besides this i did some codecleanups, which should gain performance and improve readability of the code ;).
<br><br>
Special thanks go to the guys from the Dutch Translations team. They helped me with a lot of i18n issues i didn't even know to exist :)
<br><br>
Note that i've moved the CVS tree to Gnome CVS, see the downloadpage for instruction on how to access it.
<br><br>
As always, please send me your bugreports, ideas, new colors or whatever... thnx!
