<p>
<b><i><a href="http://www.packtpub.com/manage-disk-space-partitions-with-gparted/book">Manage Partitions with GParted How-to</a></i></b> is a practical, hands-on guide providing you with step-by-step instructions to effectively organize your hard drive.
</p>

<p>
Modern disk drives can store vast amounts of information. To effectively use all of this space, you can partition disk drives into separate storage areas. These separate storage areas enable you to organize your data, improve system performance, and install and use many operating systems.
</p>

<p>
This book provides ample screen shots to help you effectively use your hard drive. You start with simple tasks that help you to identify drives and partitions. Next you progress to tasks covering the basics of how to grow, shrink, move, and copy partitions without data loss. You finish with advanced tasks that use the basics to prepare for new operating systems, migrate space between partitions, and share data among Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.
</p>

<p>
By following through the tasks, from basic to advanced, this book will empower you with the knowledge and tools to Manage Partitions with GParted.
</p>

Moving space between partitions<br>
(Become an expert)
</h1>

<p>
It can be frustrating to run out of free space in one partition (for example, <b>C:</b>) when another partition (for example, <b>D:</b>) has plenty. In this recipe we cover the steps to migrate free space from one partition to another.

<p>
Before before performing this task, we highly recommend that you backup your data. This task involves moving the start of a partition boundary, which is a high risk activity.

Notice the unallocated space between sda1 and sda2. This gap, which can be up to about 8 MiB, occurs due to having cylinder aligned and MiB aligned partitions on the same disk device. In this example, the sda1 partition was created with cylinder alignment to demonstrate this potential gap.

<p>
In order to add space to a partition, unallocated space must be available immediately adjacent to the partition. To free up this space, we use many of the recipes covered earlier.
</p>

<p>
First, we made unallocated space available by shrinking the logical partition where free space was available. Because the free space came from a logical partition inside an extended partition, and we needed to add the space to a primary partition, we had to edit three partitions to achieve the desired goal.

<p>
As mentioned in previous recipes, if you resize or move a partition containing an NTFS file system, then you should reboot into Windows twice to permit Windows to perform file system consistency checks.
</p>

<h3>
Growing or moving a partition
</h3>

<p>
To grow or move a partition, unallocated space must be available adjacent to the partition:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
When growing a logical partition, the unallocated space must be within the extended partition.
</li>
<li>
When growing a primary partition, the unallocated space must not be within the extended partition.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can move unallocated space inside or outside of an extended partition by resizing the extended partition boundaries.
